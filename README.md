# Scan Score Shine: Automated OMR Evaluation & Scoring System
Scan Score Shine is a web application to automate evaluation of OMR sheets.
It allows evaluators to upload OMR sheet images and CSV/XLSX answer keys,
and calculates the total marks accurately. The system reduces manual errors,
speeds up evaluation, and provides a dashboard to review results.

## Features
- Upload OMR sheets (images/PDFs)
- Upload answer keys (CSV/XLSX)
- Automatic image preprocessing (rotation, skew, perspective correction)
- Bubble detection using OpenCV
- Dynamic scoring based on answer key
- Total marks calculation (no hardcoded subjects)
- Dashboard to monitor evaluation and review flagged sheets
- Export results as CSV/XLSX
  
  ## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
- Backend: Python (FastAPI / Flask)
- Database: PostgreSQL / SQLite
- OMR Processing: OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy, Pillow
- Optional ML: scikit-learn / TensorFlow Lite for ambiguous bubbles
- PDF Handling: PyMuPDF / PDFPlumber
- CSV/XLSX Handling: Pandas / openpyxl
